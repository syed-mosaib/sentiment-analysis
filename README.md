# sentiment-analysis
This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that leverages the Amazon review dataset to analyze and predict the sentiment . The objective of this project is to build a robust sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.


# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Amazon review dataset, which contains millions of customer reviews across various product categories. Each review is labeled with a sentiment score, indicating whether the review is positive, negative, or neutral.


# The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the Amazon review dataset and any data-related scripts.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
src/: Source code for the sentiment analysis models and utilities.
models/: Saved models and evaluation results.
reports/: Project reports and documentation.

#Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments and key features.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Learning models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Visualization: Plotting confusion matrices, ROC curves, and sentiment distribution.
